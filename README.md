*Vengeance of the Abyssal Depths: A messy raycasting engine game in C and SDL3*

---

I made this for Grade 10 Computer Science class a while ago. It was supposed to be a whole-ass game with everything games usually have, but it unfortunately ended up only being a poorly implemented tech demo for pseudo-3D raycasting due to underestimating the scope of the project and time management. It's written in C and SDL3, and it has a Makefile, basic controls, textured walls stolen from Wolfenstein 3D, a differently colored ceiling and floor, proper collision, shading with faraway walls, shading with different-facing walls, and a prototype map.
