*Vengeance of the Abyssal Depths: A messy raycasting engine game in C*

---

I made this for Grade 10 Computer Science class a while ago. It was supposed to be a whole-ass game with everything games usually have, but it unfortunately ended up only being a poorly implemented tech demo for pseudo-3D raycasting due to underestimating the scope of the project and time management.
